AI Pulse: Exploring the Evolving Role of AI in Tech
üîó Live Demo: https://owuorviny109.github.io/AI-pulse-blog-app/


 Project Overview
AI Pulse is a fully responsive, multi-section blog website designed to explore the transformative impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on the modern technology landscape.

Built as a final front-end development project, it showcases a strong command of semantic HTML5, modular JavaScript (ES6+), and modern CSS3 techniques. The site mimics the behavior of a Single Page Application (SPA) by dynamically rendering content, allowing users to navigate fluidly between sections without full page reloads.

 Key Features
 SPA-Like Navigation
JavaScript-powered section switching simulates an SPA experience across sections like Home, What is AI?, Impacts, Blog, About, and Contact.

Animated transitions (e.g., fade-in/out) enhance flow and visual appeal.

 Responsive & Mobile-First Design
Built using CSS Flexbox and Grid to create adaptable layouts.

Media queries ensure optimized display across devices: smartphones, tablets, and desktops.

 Interactive User Interface
 Dark Mode Toggle with persistent theme settings via localStorage.

 Expandable Blog Previews featuring ‚ÄúRead More / Read Less‚Äù functionality.

‚å® Typing Animation in the hero section dynamically cycles through blog titles and themes.

 Scroll-to-Top Button appears based on scroll position for better UX on long pages.

 Content-Rich, Dynamic Sections
 What is AI?
Clickable, interactive cards explain foundational concepts like:

Core AI

Machine Learning

Deep Learning

 Impacts of AI
An animated responsive grid presents topics such as:

Automation

Job Market

Productivity

Innovation

AI in Kenya

Each topic includes real-world examples, positive/negative implications, and external resources for further exploration.

 Accessibility & Semantics
Uses semantic HTML5 elements for structure and SEO.

ARIA attributes improve accessibility for screen readers and assistive tech.

Fully keyboard-navigable UI and accessible controls.

 Modern Styling
Built with CSS Variables for scalable theming and cleaner code maintenance.

Professional visual hierarchy, elegant typography, and consistent spacing.

Scroll-based animations powered by AOS (Animate on Scroll) for subtle motion effects.

 Modular & Maintainable JavaScript
Written in modern ES6+ syntax.

Organized into modular functions for:

Navigation

Theme switching

Dynamic content display

Code is well-commented, easy to extend, and highly readable.
