🚀 Project Overview
AI Pulse is a fully responsive, multi-section blog website designed to explore the transformative impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on the modern technology landscape.

Built as a final front-end development project, it showcases a strong command of semantic HTML5, modular JavaScript (ES6+), and modern CSS3 techniques. The site mimics the behavior of a Single Page Application (SPA) by dynamically rendering content, allowing users to navigate fluidly between sections without full page reloads.

✨ Key Features
🔄 SPA-Like Navigation
JavaScript-powered section switching simulates an SPA experience across sections like Home, What is AI?, Impacts, Blog, About, and Contact.

Animated transitions (e.g., fade-in/out) enhance flow and visual appeal.

📱 Responsive & Mobile-First Design
Built using CSS Flexbox and Grid to create adaptable layouts.

Media queries ensure optimized display across devices: smartphones, tablets, and desktops.

🎨 Interactive User Interface
🌙 Dark Mode Toggle with persistent theme settings via localStorage.

📰 Expandable Blog Previews featuring “Read More / Read Less” functionality.

⌨️ Typing Animation in the hero section dynamically cycles through blog titles and themes.

⬆️ Scroll-to-Top Button appears based on scroll position for better UX on long pages.
