Project Overview
AI Pulse is a fully responsive, multi-section blog website that delves into the transformative impact of Artificial Intelligence on the technology industry. Designed to reflect modern front-end development practices, this project integrates clean, semantic HTML5, modular JavaScript (ES6+), and advanced CSS techniques to create a highly interactive user experience.

The site simulates a single-page application (SPA) feel by dynamically rendering content without page reloads, delivering a seamless and engaging interface. Built as part of a final front-end development project, AI Pulse highlights a real-world application of web technologies and is fully deployed for public access.
